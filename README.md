## 1.5.0-test.8

Four Gen 1 double-battle cards follow the actual composed sprite heads, and the camera widens to keep both near-side Pokemon in view. FireRed/LeafGreen modern commands preserve full-body sprite pixels beneath the old command window; status anchors use the selected artwork. Fixes the packaged animated BW back atlas path (dex 1–251). Includes the shared modern UI toggle and functional Gen 3 shadow/world-curve/wireframe controls from test.7.

Verified using isolated scripted profiles on latest official Gen1Recomp 0.3.1: four-card Yellow online doubles, normal battle completion with matching state hashes and intact owned parties; Crystal integrated sprite/settings checks; FireRed 1440p UI toggle, native directional input, animated back frame changes, damage, attack-stage lifetime and field return. Inspected native rendered captures, including complete FireRed back sprites and all four Yellow battlers. Final archive checks follow publication.

These remain test releases. Full cross-generation feature parity, complete animation coverage, Gen 3 shiny-context handling and exhaustive multiplayer move/disconnect scenarios are unfinished. User saves and live profiles were not touched.

Pins Double Battles 0.12.0-test.3, including the Gen 1 online faint/bench replacement synchronization fix. Five core mods in FireRed/LeafGreen; Yellow and Crystal also include Running Shoes.

## 1.5.0-test.7

Gen 1 staged battles now have separate projected status cards for all four double battlers and compact commands drawn after attack effects. MODERN BATTLE UI is a live shared setting across all three generations; OFF retains native UI. Gen 3 exposes the existing shadow, world-curve and wireframe controls. The selected-art renderer can reuse the bundled animated BW back atlases for dex 1–251; missing species retain static fallback. Custom installed atlases remain first priority. Crystal remains the default Gen 1/2 sprite pack.

TEST PRERELEASE: published before gameplay testing as requested. Full cross-generation parity, Gen 3 shiny-context handling, animated front coverage and advanced multiplayer scenarios remain unfinished.

Includes Double Battles’ Gen 2 UI opt-out fix. Five core mods in FireRed/LeafGreen; Yellow and Crystal also include Running Shoes.

## 1.5.0-test.6

TEST PRERELEASE. Battle Art now includes the complete Crystal sprite pack and its normal/shiny animations, reveal effects, trainer portraits, menu/evolution presentation and optional Gen 5 full-body staged backs.

Yellow and Crystal now contain the five core mods plus Running Shoes; FireRed/LeafGreen contains the five core mods.

Sprite pack selection requires restarting the game. Includes test.3 camera/sprite regression corrections. Source/asset checks precede publication; new gameplay/visual checks follow publication as requested. Full cross-generation feature parity and adapter-pending settings remain unfinished.

## 1.5.0-test.3

**TEST PRERELEASE — published before gameplay testing at the user’s request.** Fixes the stale indoor camera after leaving buildings and the duplicate Gen 1 battle sprite wrapper. Includes Gen 1 online doubles, HGSS overworld art (Gen 3 default; opt-in for Gen 1/2), and Battle Art right-stick/door/healing fixes.

Battle Art itself now handles front/back sprite selection across all three generations. Existing animated atlases take priority; supplied BW art is a static full-body fallback. No separate BW mod is included. Gen 1 retains ROM art by default; Crystal retains its Gen 2 animated companion and full-body backs; FireRed selects Gen 5 battle art. Change the shared Battle Art options to opt in/out.

Unsupported generation-specific settings remain visible but read-only (ADAPTER PENDING). Gen 1 doubles, new projection adapters and advanced mechanics are experimental and await gameplay verification. Gen1Recomp 0.3.1 target; no ROMs or saves.

Known risks: new Gen 1 doubles and door/healing projections have not yet been gameplay-tested; advanced moves and disconnect combinations may need fixes. Complete visual parity and all generation-specific settings adapters remain unfinished. Gen1Recomp 0.3.1 is the target engine. No ROM or player save is included. Stable releases remain available.
